# Description
In this time, I will share a simple android project on how for a user to download a file on a WebView. I took this theme because it demands me how on a WebView to download a file.
You can develop this project according to what you will do. If there are shortcomings in what I share, I apologize profusely

# Feature
The features in this project are:
* Display web on android project (Using WebView)
* Dialog or pop up for permission to access files on the smartphone you are using
* Using the Progress Bar widget for the updating process to display the website
* Added Toast if the file is in the process of downloading

# Reference
The references that I use to create a WebView that can download a file are as follows:

Channel Youtube => [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEg8VloXos)
Blog Website    => [Website](https://weblearners.blogspot.com/2020/04/how-to-enable-download-in-android.html)

I found this reference on the Youtube channel. Maybe, this can be used as a reference when you are also working on an android project that matches the theme I'm working on. 
I hope, this is useful for you.
